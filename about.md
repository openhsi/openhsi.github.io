OpenHSI is an initiative to make hyperspectral technology more accessible to remote sensing practitioners through an open-source design and software. The collaboration consists of the following people:

### Dr. Bradley Evans | Team Leader (Affiliate, The University of Sydney)

Brad’s research is focused on the use of Earth Observation, using spectral cameras, UAV’s, Aircraft, CubeSats and Satellites to enhance our understanding of the Carbon and Water cycle. In a practical sense, this involves mapping and modelling plant growth, crop yield and other plant related activities remotely. This research is achieved through using the state-of-the-art in sensors, Hyperspectral Imaging Spectrometers, Thermal imagers and a range of Multispectral and Spectroscopy based approaches.

Brad has been a Director of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network Ecosystem Modelling and Scaling Infrastructure, and Director of Sydney Informatics Hub.

In recent years, Brad has worked on novel ways of mapping plant growth (E.g. NASA’s OCO2 based Solar Induced Fluorescence based model: https://sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2017/10/13/new-technique-tracks-plant-photosynthesis-from-space.html) and innovative ways to improve existing approaches (Nature Plants: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-017-0006-8 ).

Chris's research focuses on the development (design, construction, characterisation, and implementation) of cutting-edge compact optical instruments that harness the latest photonic technologies, originally for astronomical applications. More recently, he has been using techniques and methods developed for astronomy to tackle a broader range of problems in academia and industry, specifically in remote earth observation and agriculture.

<td valign="top">

Dr Terry Cocks graduated from the University of Adelaide and firstly joined the CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics to develop techniques for the remote sensing of cloud properties.  He then joined the CSIRO Division of Mineral Physics to develop airborne instrumentation for the remote sensing of the earth’s surface for applications in geological mapping and mineral exploration. 

In 1989, he left CSIRO to start Integrated Spectronics (now IntSpec Systems), a company to develop and market spectral sensing instruments.  The company released the first hand held SWIR spectrometer for in-field mineral analysis (PIMA) and later the HyMap series of airborne hyperspectal scanners.  The company also developed a field spectrometer for horticultural applications and a prototype imaging spectrometer suitable for deployment on UAV’s 

In 1998, he founded HyVista Corporation to undertake contract airborne hyperspectral surveys and deliver processed maps to clients.  HyVista Corporation went on to become a significant supplier of imagery and maps to a world-wide range of government agencies, research institutions and commercial organisations such as mining companies.

Iver Cairns has over 30 years of experience in space physics and space weather research. His primary expertise is in the theory, simulation, and analysis of plasma waves and radio emissions. Iver has over 300 published, refereed, papers in journals and books. He is a Co-Investigator on NASA’s STEREO mission and, since June 2019, on NASA’s two new SMEX missions, PUNCH and TRACERS. Prof. Cairns has held multiple leadership positions in Australian and international scientific societies, including the Asia Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS), the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), International Association for Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA), and the Solar Terrestrial and Space Physics (STSP) Group of the Australian Institute of Physics.  Currently he is Chair of COSPAR’s Finance Committee and of the Program Committee for the 2020 COSPAR Assembly in Sydney, as well as the longtime Co-Chair of the Australian Space Research Conference. Within Australia Iver led the 2010-2019 Decadal Plan for Australian Space Science and chaired the Academy of Science’s National Committee for Space Science 2004 – 2011. Since then he has worked to convince Governments to invest in the space sector. He led the INSPIRE-2 CubeSat project, which launched in May 2017 and re-entered still working in November 2018. Currently Iver leads CUAVA, the ARC Training Centre for CubeSats, UAVs, and Their Applications, which is training people, solving research problems, and working on commercial outcomes for its industry, academic, and governmental partners.
